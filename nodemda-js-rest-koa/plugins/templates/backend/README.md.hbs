{{model.name}} Backend
==========

{{model.name}} Backend is a backend REST application for NodeJS.

Development
------

The first step in the development process is to edit the UML model found in the `uml` directory.
Create a class diagram according to the NodeMDA standards documented in the NodeMDA README.  Once
the model has been completed, generate code using with NodeUML by selecting the "Generate code from UML"
option in VSCode.

Once that is complete, the generated code can be run from the developer desktop like so:

1. Be sure MongoDB is running on your desktop machine.

2. Start the backend server:

```
cd backend

npm install

npm run dev
```

The backend server will be served with `nodemon` when started with `npm run dev`, which allows for quick
hotswap development of backend code.

If you need to change the schema or service definitions, re-edit the UML model, then regenerate the code with NodeMDA.
