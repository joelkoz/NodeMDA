{{model.name}} Front End
==========

{{model.name}} Front End is a web front end application written in React using the Mantine interface library.

Development
------

The first step in the development process is to edit the UML model found in the `uml` directory.
Create a class diagram according to the NodeMDA standards documented in the NodeMDA README.  Once
the model has been completed, generate code using with NodeUML by selecting the "Generate code from UML"
option in VSCode.

Once that is complete, the generated code can be run from the developer desktop like so:

1. Be sure your backend code is running on your desktop machine.

2. Start the frontend server:

```
cd frontend

npm install

npm run start
```


4. Test and modify the code as needed:

Navigate to http://localhost:3000 in your browser to view the application while running in development mode.
